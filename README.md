# Hackathon 2024 Lanyard ID Generator

I thought I'd have a bit of fun and create a lanyard ID generator for our hackathon.

We created our base design in Canva, and exported all layers except text which are added back via code.

Open sourced as of 24th July 2024 / after the event.

## Reference

To get custom fonts, I used the [jsPDF fontconverter](https://peckconsulting.s3.amazonaws.com/fontconverter/fontconverter.html)

Made using [qrcode](https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode), [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) and [TidyHQ-Node](https://s3ansh33p.github.io/TidyHQ-Node/)
