# Hackathon 2024 Lanyard ID Generator

Hopefully this makes sense as I wrote this from 3-5am :)

## Reference

To get custom fonts, I used the [jsPDF fontconverter](https://peckconsulting.s3.amazonaws.com/fontconverter/fontconverter.html)

Made using [qrcode](https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode) and [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF)
